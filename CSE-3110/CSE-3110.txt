CSE-3110: Iterative Algorithm 1
1)
1.1) Search, sort and merge algorithms (for arrays) all use loops to iterate through the data.
1.2) Search finds data, Sort organizes data, and Merge combines data.
1.3) The main data structure they are used n in lists, but you can create different versions of these
algorithms for many other data structures.
1.4) Search goes through the list, until it finds the data, or reaches the end of the list. (worst TC is O(n))
There are many ways to mke a sort algorithm, but the most common is to use two loops to go through the list
and swap the places of the data. (worst TC is O(n^2))
Merge makes a new list after going through two lists, and comparing the data in them. (worst TC is O(n1+n2))
1.5) Linear search goes through the list, and compares the data to the data you are looking for. (worst TC is O(n))
Binary search goes through the list, but only compares the data to the data you are looking for. (worst TC is O(log n))
1.6) Exchange sort goes through the list, and compares the data to the data next to it. If the data is larger than
the data next to it, it swaps the places of the data.
Selection sort is like exchange sort but the swap happens at the end of the iteration.
Insertion sort build a new list, and goes through the list, and compares the data to the data in the new list.
1.7) Merge sort is rarely used, but if it is you can customize a bunch of stuff, like if duplicates are
used, or if the data is sorted in a specific way.

3-4) These are just saying "make sure it can run". my program can run, and I didnt have to change anything.
