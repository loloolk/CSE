CSE-3120: Object-Oriented Programming 1
1)
1.1) the main thing that OOP is used for is encapsulation of objects, within other objects.
This is useful because it allows for the creation of objects that are more complex than the default types.
Inheritance allows for those objects to be organised into a tree structure, which allows for the creation of even more complex objects.
Modularity and polymorphism allow for the creation of objects that can be used in a variety of ways, and can be used in a variety of places.
1.2) The main difference between OOP and procedural programming is that OOP is based on the idea of objects, while procedural programming is based on the idea of functions.
2)
(See "oop.cpp" file)
3-4) These are just saying "make sure it can run". my program can run, and I didnt have to change anything.
