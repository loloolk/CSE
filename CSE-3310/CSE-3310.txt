CSE-3310: Recursive Algorithms
Recursive functions or procedures are a type of programming construct that define themselves in terms of themselves.
1.1 Key features of recursive algorithms include:
1.1.1 self-referencing definition, where the algorithm defines itself in terms of itself
1.1.2 the use of a base case, which is the end condition for the recursion
1.2 Recursive algorithms follow a "divide and conquer" approach, where a problem is broken down into smaller subproblems until a base case is reached.
1.3 Recursive and iterative operations can be interchangeable in some cases, depending on the problem and solution approach.
1.4 Recursion and iteration have differences in terms of programmer efficiency, space efficiency, and time efficiency.
1.5 Recursion is important in creating dynamic data structures, such as trees and linked lists.
1.6 Tail end recursion and head end recursion are two types of recursion with different implementation and efficiency characteristics.
1.7 The system stack is used to keep track of recursive operations and ensure proper execution.
